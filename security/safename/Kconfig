	help
	  This selects Safename, which restricts what filenames can be created
	  (e.g., it can prevent creation of filenames with control characters,
	  beginning with dash, or ones that are not UTF-8).
	  This can be used as a hardening measure to counter certain
	  kinds of attacks.  You should still write code that handles
	  these unusual filenames correctly, but until all incorrect
	  code stops getting written, this hardening mechanism can be useful.
	  For a general discussion of the problem, see:

	  Further information can be found in
	  Documentation/security/Safename.txt.

	  If you are unsure how to answer this question, answer N.
