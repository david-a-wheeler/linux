Squelch is a Linux Security Module that restricts what filenames can be created
(e.g., it can prevent creation of filenames with control characters,
beginning with dash, or ones that are not UTF-8).
This can be used as a hardening measure to counter certain
kinds of attacks.  It a minor module, so it can be included along with
a major module.

Many POSIX systems typically allow filenames to contain any sequence of bytes
other than / and \0.  However, many users and developers presume that filenames
can't include control characters (like tab and newline), can't start with "-",
and are encoded as a sequence of valid UTF-8 characters.
This difference between what users and developers expect, as compared
to reality, can lead to defects and security vulnerabilities.
The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) includes 3 weakneses related to this
(CWE 78, CWE 73, and CWE 116). Examples of vulnerabilities from this
problem include CVE-2011-1155 (logrotate) and
CVE-2013-7085 (uscan in devscripts).
For a general discussion of the problem, see:

You should still write code that handles unusual filenames correctly.
However, until all code is correct (and stays that way),
this hardening mechanism can be useful.

This module only prevents *creating* filenames with certain
characteristics; it makes no attempt to counter them at mount time.
This is still useful, since in many systems it's not possible
to mount untrusted filesystems.  A future version might add such
checking as an option.
