Safename is a Linux Security Module to harden systems against attack
by restricting what filenames can be created
(e.g., it can prevent creation of filenames with control characters like
newline, filenames beginning with dash, or filenames that are not UTF-8).

Safename can be used to harden a system against attacks
that are based on creating unusual filenames to exploit
imperfectly-written programs and user commands.
Safename enforces rules that many users follow anyway, so non-attackers
will typically not notice when it's enabled.
Safename is a minor Linux Security Module, so it can be
included along with a major module like SELinux or AppArmor.

The TL;DR version is that you can enforce rules to require filenames obey
the default rules, which counter many attacks, by doing:

    echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/safename/mode_for_unprivileged
    echo 1 > /proc/sys/kernel/safename/mode_for_privileged

Below are more details.

Many POSIX systems, including Linux, normally allow filenames to contain
any sequence of bytes other than / and \0 (pathnames are a sequence
of filenames) if the filesystem format allows it.
However, many users and developers presume that filenames
can't include control characters (like tab and newline), can't start with "-",
and are a sequence of valid UTF-8 characters (e.g., for display).
This difference between what users and developers expect, as compared
to reality, can lead to security vulnerabilities.
The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) includes 3 weakneses related to this
(CWE 78, CWE 73, and CWE 116). Examples of vulnerabilities from this
problem include CVE-2011-1155 (logrotate) and
CVE-2013-7085 (uscan in devscripts).
For a general discussion of the problem, see:
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/fixing-unix-linux-filenames.html
There have long been complaints about this, e.g., see the rant by
Jamie Zawinski in the "The Unix-haters handbook" starting on page 167.
On systems that enforce the default Safename rules on all tasks,
many filename-related constructs that are widely used, but normally unsafe,
become safe and work in all cases.

You should still normally write code that handles unusual filenames correctly,
because that makes your code portable.
However, it is not trivial to handle arbitrary filenames correctly; see:
http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/filenames-in-shell.html
Until all code correctly handles arbitrary filenames, and stays that way,
Safename can be useful as a security hardening mechanism.

This module addresses three different cases, where
"privileged" means "has CAP_SYS_ADMIN":
1. A non-malicious unprivileged application is tricked by an
   attacker into creating a malicious filename. Later errors in some code
   (privileged or not) cause the filename to be misinterpreted and
   lead to an exploit.
2. A malicious untrusted user directly creates a malicious filename.
   Again, later errors in some code (privileged or not)
   cause the filename to be misinterpreted and lead to an exploit.
3. Like #1, but a *privileged* application
   is tricked into creating a malicious filename, which later leads to
   an exploit.  For this case, you need to prevent privileged processes
   from creating those filenames.  This module lets you decide if you
   want to prevent privileged processes from creating such filenames.

This module only prevents *creating* filenames with certain
characteristics within currently-mounted filesystems.
It makes no attempt to counter unusual filenames at mount time.
This is still useful, since in many systems it's not possible
to mount untrusted filesystems.  A future version of this module
might add such mount-time checking as an option.

This module's functions can be configured via "/proc/sys/kernel/safename/".
Within that directory there are the following configuration values:

* mode_for_unprivileged: Mode used for unprivileged tasks (0..3).
  We consider tasks unpriviliged if they lack capability CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
  The allowed mode values are:
  * 0 = not enforced, no reports on failed requests.
  * 1 = enforced, no reports on failed requests.
  * 2 = not enforced, reports made on failed requests.
  * 3 = enforced, reports made on failed requests.
  Default is 0: no enforcement, no report.
* mode_for_privileged: Mode used for unprivileged tasks (0..3).
  We consider tasks privileged if they have capability CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
  The mode values the same as mode_for_unprivileged.
  Default is 0: no enforcement, no report.
* utf8: If true, include a check to see if filenames are valid UTF-8 (0..1).
  Default is 0: Do not check.
* permitted_bytes_initial: The set of bytes allowed as the first
  byte of a filename.  Default value is 33-44,46-125,128-254;
  this omits control chars, space, '-', '~', 0x7f (DEL),
  and 0xff (part of FFFE).
* permitted_bytes_middle: The set of bytes allowed in the middle of
  a filename (not including the first and last bytes).
  Filenames less than three bytes long will never consult this value.
  Default value 32-126,128-254; this omits control chars, 0x7f (DEL),
  and 0xff (part of FFFE).
* permitted_bytes_final: The set of bytes allowed as the last byte of
  a filename. A filename exactly 1 byte long must meet the requirements
  of both permitted_bytes_initial and and permitted_bytes_final.
  Default values 33-126,128-254; this omits control chars, space,
  0x7f (DEL), and 0xff (part of FFFE).

If at least one mode is either 1 or 3, we say that this module is 'enforcing'.

Currently this module returns -EPERM if a filename fails to meet criteria.
In the future a different (more specific) error value might be returned.

The POSIX 2013 specification says in XBD 4.7 (file portability, page 109)
that for a filename to be portable across implementations
conforming to POSIX, "it shall consist only of the
portable character set as defined in Section 3.278".
These characters are [A-Za-z0-9._-].
POSIX also notes that "applications should avoid using
filenames that have the <hyphen> character as the
first character since this may cause problems when
filenames are passed as arguments."
